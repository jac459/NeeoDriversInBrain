Change WiFi Region
 Some may be interested in changing the WiFi region of the Brain they have.  For example, you live in the US and have an EU Brain (hence less power in your WiFi signal)
  To do this, you need some skills with WinSCP/Putty or equivelent to copy/move/delete files.  Use sudo command.
   
   Step 1.  Copy the wlan.region file from the /tmp to your pc or edit it in Terminal.
    Change text stating EU to US and Save.  Now move it to a folder in the Brain like drivers or NeeoShare that you can access.
     Also copy it a second time and rename it wlandummy.region
   
   Step 2.  We need to use the RM command to delete the existing wlan.region file in /tmp.  Then we need to use the MV command to move our new edited wlan.region file to /tmp folder.
   
   Step 3.  Copy the neeoenv.sh file from the /etc/profile.d to your pc or edit it in Terminal.
    Change text stating wlan.region to wlandummy.region and Save.  Now move it to a folder in the Brain like drivers or NeeoShare that you can access.
  
   Step 4.  We need to use the RM command to delete the existing neeoenv.sh file in /etc/profile.d.  Then we need to use the MV command to move our new edited neeoenv.sh file to /etc/profile.d folder.
   Reboot.
